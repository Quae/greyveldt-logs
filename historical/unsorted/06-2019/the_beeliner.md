``` ♫ City of beacons, beacon of the land n' sea,```

```Land of unsurpassed tech-no-lo-gee, ```

```Sea of pleasures, fortress of vita-li-ty,```

```Now we have trains! Trains to carry you-u-u-ooh ooh ooh```

```n' me! ♫ ```

Ten harpists on dollies, three violinists on roller skates gyrate in circles around a grand piano on the great rotating mirror dias in the center of the Beacon Station crowd. In the outer ring of this spectacle, a troup of butterfly mimes act out each line of the song as the literal peacock chanteur warbles the 'modern' cover of this passe Beaconite diddy. This is what happens when you let your intern plan a celebration.

Cross-armed and surly against a wall with oversized crownmolding and a shell-pink chair rail, a careless vision-obscuring forelock is the only thing protecting this crowd from half of two evil eyes.

"First time in Beacon?"

She casts a sidelong glance. A tall, narrow man in blue pinstripes has sidled up next to her, sporting a pencil thin mustache and greased-down dirty blonde curls. He is smiling ingratiatingly.
"If only it were so."

Not seeming to take her meaning, the man (he was drunk on the fruits of her libations table, she now realized, as he reeked of false cherries and seltzer belch) instead took comfort in newfound rapport with this beautiful young lady. "Ah, quite right, I daresay." He drew in a long heady breath of perfumed city summer air. "One never gets to relive those first moments twice, mm? That's the bittersweet nature of finally arriving home..." He lit himself the spliff he'd recently procured from a crystal bowl under the live-awning. Inhaling deeply, he closed his eyes to fully savor the ecstasy of this delicious moment in time, allowing the smoke and fleeting sensations of the day to suffuse his consciousness without visual disturbance. 

Exhaling, he concluded, "In that sense - you really can never go home again..."

When he opened his eyes, she was gone.

-------

"Ha ha ha ha if they play that song one more time I'm going to **bite** somebody." remarked a slightly-less-unremarkable-than-usual Sentinel standing cornered between a waste bin and a lamp post, taking full advantage of the din to keep his words from all but the most attentive of ears, and masking them further with a gaping, saccharine smile.

One would be forgiven for mistaking this particular officer of the city for part of the performing troupe with his large and pointed ears, fur-covered face, and the telltale pale blue glow in his eyes that marked him as one of the crystal-blessed beastfolk of the eastern woodlands. Several already had, despite him being in full uniform and stood aside from the thick throng along the immaculate new platform.

"If you good people could start getting rowdy and give me an excuse to begin bashing your heads together that would be fan**tastic**." he went on to say as he treated the doe-eyed child of a pointing parent to a flawlessly regal wave and clicked his tongue against one of his sizable fangs in relief when the youngster's short-spanned attention sent them both scurrying elsewhere.

"...How long until next rotation."

-------

"I'm beginning to see merit in these complaints of favoritism," came the stern response from an equally stern looking woman as she stepped in beside him from the crowd.

She too was in uniform, but hers was the sleek, fresh spidersilk craft ordered for this occasion. It matched her militant posture well. Human, mostly, with red hair pulled back in a short ponytail to show off the markers of her mixed ancestry-- dark patterned spots lining her temple and working their way down her neck and disappearing beneath the high collar of the celebratory uniform.

"There's an occupancy needing filled on the Beeliner security force," she explained succinctly, "You're with me."

Then, with the barest hint of a smile that most would claim imagined, she said, "Unfortunately, you'll have to remain in Sentinel regalia.'

-------

He loosed a low whistle loud enough to draw curious eyes from nearby revelers, "Don't try to tell me you've still got favours left to leverage, Spots. Who'd you put in the Medbay for that? **Randal?** Hassiri? Randal? Please tell me it was Randal."

-------

"I am not at liberty to discuss the circumstances of the change," she replied in deadpan, green eyes unyielding. 

The crowd surged around them, largely unseeing of the two city protectors.

After a few more beats of stoic professionalism, as if entirely unrelated, she struck up conversationally as she prepared to dive once more into the throng: "I hear Randal needed to straighten out a clerical error in his health assessment. Until he does so, he's ineligible for out-Beacon deployment. Do you see that woman?" 

The redhead nodded subtly to the well dressed lady taking hasty leave of the rambling drunkard, "Note that one, and behave yourself if you cross paths." She eyed her companion sidelong briefly, "I mean it."

-------

Down the tracks, past the clamorous proletariat and panting chimney of the restless railcar, Rusalka stirred the cooling xuxonite cubes around the last of the muddled mint in her cup. It seemed she'd finally shook off the babbling drunkard in his decades-old pinstripe clownsuit. Above her sun-haloed hair, colorful streamer fringe danced in the breeze.

At the other end of the mulling, purposeless procession, this same breeze tickled a cherry red ribbon shimmying across the train's filgreed cab door, never before opened to the public. The breeze went on to caress the capped head of finely dressed eventgoer who sported an immaculate mustache and an only slightly less elegant belly. He was preoccupied, it seemed, dangling an oversized pair of jewel-encrusted scissors the size of a suitcase, embroiled in a heated discussion with a man a head taller and infinitely more garish. On the third gust of hot wind, the bowler hat was tipped clean off the smaller man's pate. As though suspecting some prankster at work, he whipped his head around this way and that, searching for the origin of the sensation before comically patting his head, then noticing his pricey ornament tumbling under the polished coupling rods of the huffing, muttering engine.

Hastily passing the scissors to the fellow with whom he'd been arguing moment's prior, he levered down to his silk-clad hands and knees, delicately leaning to peer between the train wheels, carefully shifting weight only to the soles of his shiny black shoes. Endeavoring to snatch the escaped hat settled on the track, he found - to his chagrin - that it was all too much - and went toppling. A slender long legged woman in a suitjacket and tiny skirt darted forward, catching him just pre-faceplant, but not soon enough to protect the knees of his trousers. Behind them, the tall, garish man guffawed, then directed his attention at the bandshell. He snapped his fingers a few times at the conductor. But the conductor's eyes were elsewhere.

-------

"You always mean it" said the uniformed bat, with gaze tracking the woman on the warpath with laser-like focus, "and I~ never listen."

Meanwhile, separated from all the pomp and ceremony of the occasion by little more distance than the span of the railcars themselves, an almost unbroken stream of workmen were still loading all manner of shipping containers into the train's multiple cargo carriages. Crates, kegs, barrels, and boxes of all sizes and odors making their way up access ramps to be crammed as tightly as they could be made to fit together for the coming voyage, with nary a watchful eye in sight - and why would there be? Such things went on at the rail station on a daily basis without cause for caution.

So far as it mattered to anyone not privileged enough to be part of the festivities, it was business as usual.

-------

Rusalka took one final sip from her cup and abandoned it, striding purposely forward. As she did so, the conductor met her eyes, beamed, and then squawked. The band changed its tune.

They began to play an upbeat disco-esque arrangement of, "Our Lady Auburn, Queen of the Rails".

Hailing the end of the 'smooth scat jazz' segment of the day's musical theme, this literal tone shift worked like a charm. All attention was immediately directed to the band, and then immediately after directed to the one the band was facing. The crowd parted as Rusalka sashayed along the platform, toward the band, toward the mustached man with scuffed trousers, toward his attractive assistant, and toward the tall one, who was dressed in red and gold brocade and an armload of bangles, holding a giant pair of scissors and still couldn't snag the band's attention from the current spectacle of Rusalka.
Just walking.

The mustached man, having recovered his hat, seemed also to have recovered his wits. He brushed down his besmirched suit and forcibly wrenched the scissors out of the tall man's hands. The tall man bristled, fists clenching. His eyes wished blight on the back of the short man's perfectly capped head.

The crowd was hushed. As Rusalka approached the men and assistant, the band, too, hushed, so all could hear them speak.

"Welcome to the brand new home of the Beacon-Drosera Railway!" bellowed the tall man suddenly.
All heads turned to the tall man. Rusalka paused midstride. He'd taken the megaphone dangling beside the cab door while all eyes were on her.

"Today we celebrate the grand opening of this (2.5 hour) express rail line from this very special town to the new Drosera Thicket processing facility. We'd like to thank--"

Hereupon, Rusalka overcame surprise and rapidly closed the distance between herself and this topheavy brocade-clad oaf. Seeing this now, he extended a hand to her just as she arrived, "--my fellow council members, and in particular, Rusie Luyus - let's give her a hand, huh? She planned this whole thing. I mean, the music. All the polkas. You folks love polkas right?" He waggled his elbow at the crowd. Some laughed, others seemed conflicted. Rusalka was now toe to toe with him glowering up at his smug, rosie-cheeked face.
"Alright, alright everybody - little joke, just a little joke. Rusie's a great sport. We love her. Who doesn't? I mean...she isn't shy about loving people back, depending on how you define the word! Ohh, I'm just kidding, doll." The last was addressed to Rusalka directly, with a wink.

"Aaanyway, yadayadayada, what I'm here to say is that this rail, sponsored by my guys at Sunshine Corps, are really pleased you could all make it out today to see our baby, this beautiful train we've been building for you, for the businessmen, for the future of our great nations, begin its long career of service." He reached for the giant jeweled scissors then, but Rusalka ripped them out of the little man's grasp quicker, and held them, momentarily, open as she smiled with ferocious charisma at the unblinking upstager.

Incidentally, the scissor blades were level with his lower extremities. She reached for the megaphone. "That's about all there is to say about the train, but here's Rusie Luyus with a little standup comedy," he concluded.

-------

"Waste me." the bat muttered as the MC had barely gotten into his opening remarks, mindful to keep his voice low now that the commotion had died down. He looked to his partner in crime prevention with a frown, "Bossman, I had a songbird lined up to bring me a juicy worm not long after this shin-ding wound down. I gotta get a line to her to move up the timetable if I'm going to be out of the city the rest of the day."

He had already angled his back towards the end of the platform and was taking his first few back-trotting steps in that direction as he aimed his thumb over his shoulder.

-------

The tall man grinned again at the crowd and handed over the megaphone gently. Then stepped away from Rusalka & the giant scissors, covering his bottom and pantomiming nervous glances over his shoulder. A few folks in the crowd chuckled.

Rusalka, deadpan, swooshed up in an impressive fluttering of feathered hairpieces and proceeded undeterred.
"Why, Councilman Calhoun, your modesty is overwhelming."

She smiled at the crowd, rutilant jewels and glitter shimmering against the morning sun. The masses gazed wretchedly back. Old women in babushkas, snot nosed toddlers in frilly pinafores now tugging on belt loops to go home, self-congratulatory sneers of trophy wives, beer-bellied working men scratching themselves and sniggering. No one here would know a good time if it went home with them for a week. They'd all let a good time sleep on the floor while they took the bed.

"What comes now is no joke, people. This train, the Beeliner, is your one and only firstclass ticket to a life few of you ever imagined. To experiences few folks are bold enough to grasp. You're all safe now. In this familiar, comfortable little town. Some of us," she smiled at Calhoun, "Believe it's all within our control. Our lives are quiet now...like a sensory deprivation chamber. Have you been listening? No music. Polka isn't music. Our view here is monochrome." She gestured around and let that sink in. The crowd's energy seemed to sink with it. The little mustached man twisted his handkerchief in his fingers, tapping his toes inside their shiny black shoe.

Rusalka's clear voice cracked down on them like lightning. "Have you wanted color? Have you wanted noise? New, delicious, tastes? Have you been dancing narrowly on a very...crowded...floor?

"This train's for you. The world awaits. The Beeliner leaves now!"

She twirled and cut the ribbon!

-------

"If you miss the launch," the woman warned, her stride unhindered towards the Beeliner as Razor peeled off, "I will never forgive you."

The woman hauled herself into a rail car, bypassing the congested loading ramp, and disappeared within the dark interior without so much as a backwards glance at the bat-kin. They both had work to do.

-------

His response was a broad shrug and an expression that wordlessly begged the question "what can I do?" Then the uniformed batm'n spun around and hastened his way to the end and down from the platform, firing a quick look to the left, then turning right and scooting away behind the tail car of the train. He eyeballed the porters still moving cargo aboard as he passed; only a few cases left. A smile creased his thin lips, giving a peek at the upper left of his prominent fangs. Cutting it close. Just the way he liked it.

In short order he was tucked just around the corner of one of the supporting pillars for the canopy over the railyard, out of sight from prying eyes, if only just. He was already halfway out of his patrolman's coat, split between unfastening the last few buttons with one hand while the other arm already wriggled and twisted to extract itself from its sleeve.

Prompted by something imperceptible he inquired, "Were you able to get everything?"

-------

"I--Yes, I do believe so" says a small shadow, perched on the top of one of the pillars. The robes it wears, though modest and made of soft, pastel browns and whites, has been made with plenty of care and love
A constant clickety-clickety-clack can be heard as the tiny thing climbs down with surprising swiftness for something so small-- Although back up there it was hard to tell at a first glance, now that they're moving it's quite simple to tell that this being has more than one pair of legs they're moving atop of.

From underneat the cloack, two fuzzy, tiny hands in white and orange produce perfectly-folded civilian clothes in Razor's size, down to a tee. They're all together in a lovely square, tied with a little silken bow atop... underneath which is a dagger with a curved blade. "I ah, I thought this may come in handy. It's never too good to be too safe, yes-yes?" Their voice feels raspy and forcedly muted down, as if they were scared of talking too much.

They raise their arms to make it easier for the man to handle the clothing, and the robe slips just a little down their arm-- which is black as coal in comparison. They lower both as soon as they notice, and mutter an apologetic "I'm so sorry"

Gosh, why him out of all people? Shouldn't the actual representative be here? All they said is that they weren't available and that, as the second-in-line for such duties they were supposed to attend in his stead, but.. Ourgh. Of course he'd miss out on something like this! Frukka always loves to skip all the stuff that'd be "boring" to him. He should have planned as much

-------

While the arachnid was loathe to permit even such a small amount of its body to be exposed, the bat was ... clearly of the opposite persuasion, barely having discarded his up-until-then prestine jacket in the dirt beneath him and already dropping his trousers. His pale blue gaze fell upon the blade as he straightened back up, sounding his approval with a sharp click made by his tongue striking upon a fang.

"If you're trying to earn a fat bonus you're on the right track, kid." he said with a grin as he took the whole parcel off his accomplice's hands. Peeling apart the carefully-folded sleeves and leggings revealed the ledger hidden away within, and still having yet to even begin redressing himself the bat first began scanning the documents it contained, flipping forward and back repeatedly through its few thin pages. The more he went back and forth, the more his frown seemed to deepen, until all at once he leveled a cheerful smile on the shorter-statured being and dropped the ledger and knife atop his piled uniform.

"So! Ever ridden a train before?" the bat asked, and immediately set about donning the matching black leather jacket and slacks that had just been delivered to him.

-------

The engineer sits at a dining booth table outside the cargo bay, shuffling through a dense stack of legal-format papers with a look of bafflement that often accompanies his current blood-alcohol saturation; the reactions of attractive, charismatic women; and postsecondary maths. These things being as they were, for Harris Humes the expression was most immediately a reaction to elementary math.

The numbers on the papers didn't match the cargo in the bay. But he couldn't call anyone on it. Outside the window, he noted that the mustached station supervisor was glancing fretfully between gods' gift to man and the tall gilded clown who'd tusseled with that gift over the scissors (this Harris observed when he first exited the cargo bay and pulled apart the luxurious silk drapes, to check the status of the day's proceedings). He couldn't interrupt the speech, unfortunately. Not with this whole crowd watching. Bad enough he wasn't manning the helm - he was expected to be ready for action at this point on the formal itinerary. Instead, he was way back in the lavish dining car fustling through inventory logs and drumming his fingers over a minor clerical error.

But what if it was not just a clerical error? What if cargo was being shipped to the wrong destination? A box full of genetically engineered labradoodles for the dutchess of Kroug? 

Or--what if this was a trap? What if that creep Franko had deliberately planted the wrong items aboard this critical, high profile first run - out of envy? 

Clutching his fists unconsciously, Harris finally recalled that moment when the Board chose _Harris_, over all other engineers, young and old, over even Franko - widely considered the best - to steer this monumental ride on its historic journey. Damn it--of _course_ it was Franko's doing!

Harris knew then that he had to tell someone - report this before it ruined his career! In a myopic daze, he leapt to his feet and barrelled toward the door--

Rusalka gathers her three feathery gilded ruby skirts to mount the stairs, opening the freshly deribboned cab door and stepping inside --

Full body slamming right into none other than the blue pinstriped idiot from before. The impact causes her to tumble sidelong and topple to the floor, as his foot remained dumbly anchored on one of her elegant skirts, jerking it out from under her sanguine mothfluff-trimmed bodice. Breaking her fall with her hands, her many skirts were cast askew, the long layers snaking high up to her henna-painted thigh, revealing - only momentarily - a most peculiar looking device clamped among the garters on her leg.
Suddenly she jerked her skirt over it. Harris' hapless eyes rose reluctantly to meet her own venemous gaze, ablaze with unbridled fury.

Then a torrent of passengers came pouring in to the cabin like a school of salmon making for the promised land.

Rusalka stood in an instant and was gone - limping away before anyone likely even noticed she'd stumbled.

Dumbfounded, Harris searched for her departing figure in the crowd for several moments, jostled this way and that by the flood of bodies stirring past. Wishing he could rewind time. The clatter of someone brushing by the papers out of his hand awakened him from this stupor.

-------

Others would have felt shy, awkward even! About an adult man just going stark-dang-naked in front of them-- but either _this_ specific Sciame is super cool with it, or spiders as a whole don't... mind clothing too much. Guess it's not as important without family jewels to cover, eh?

The idea of a bonus sounds... nice? He really isn't doing anything that he wasn't asked to do by those above him, really-- and he only added the knife as an after-thought, pondering over the implications and risks that his "colleague" is bound to find on his own quest. 
"...Wait what di-- excuseme? What did you say?"

...Ride the train? The-- the BeeLiner? They uh, they didn't _think_ there'd be... more to this! Wasn't he supposed to just Give the parcel, and nothing else? Just do this, go somewhere else, mmmaybe have lunch before heading home?

"...I guess I haven't?"

-------

"I asked if you've ever gotten to ride on one of these trains before." Razor said, jerking his thumb over his shoulder in the general direction of the one that was probably going to start pulling out any moment now, following the errand bug's answer with a new question, "Had any practice fighting hand to hand? Think you could take a human down without killing them?"

-------

"N-no? No to the uh to the uh train question."

He lights up a little at the last question "We regularly hunt for food-- I have some training for such occasions. Um, I think I could... handle my strength? I uh"

He wrings his hands together, for a bit. One step (Three? He Does have six legs) back.

"Is... I didn't _know_ I'd have to, uh, do battle."

-------

"I'm not saying you _will_ have to." the bat said with all the same cheer he's thus far addressed the spider using, stooping and, from amongst the disheveled pile of his belongings, retrieving the dagger, his firearm, and his badge. He was still smiling when he straightened up, tucking each into the inside of his jacket, which evidently had some space for stowing and concealing such things. He then pulled on his collar, and at the bottom seam of the jacket, inspecting it for any telltale creases or bulges that might hint at its hidden occupants, looking all the more pleased to find none.

"I just wanted to know how worried about you I'd need to be if _I_ get into a fight." he added only then, after he was finished attending to himself, loosing another enthusiastic click, "Well? I'm ready if you are!"

-------

``` ♫ City of beacons, beacon of the land n' sea,```

```Land of unsurpassed tech-no-lo-gee, ```

```Sea of pleasures, fortress of vita-li-ty,```

```Now we have trains! Trains to carry you-u-u-ooh ooh ooh```

```n' me! ♫ ```

Ten harpists on dollies, three violinists on roller skates gyrate in circles around a grand piano on the great rotating mirror dias in the center of the Beacon Station crowd. In the outer ring of this spectacle, a troup of butterfly mimes act out each line of the song as the literal peacock chanteur warbles the 'modern' cover of this passe Beaconite diddy. This is what happens when you let your intern plan a celebration.

Cross-armed and surly against a wall with oversized crownmolding and a shell-pink chair rail, a careless vision-obscuring forelock is the only thing protecting this crowd from half of two evil eyes.

"First time in Beacon?"

She casts a sidelong glance. A tall, narrow man in blue pinstripes has sidled up next to her, sporting a pencil thin mustache and greased-down dirty blonde curls. He is smiling ingratiatingly.
"If only it were so."

Not seeming to take her meaning, the man (he was drunk on the fruits of her libations table, she now realized, as he reeked of false cherries and seltzer belch) instead took comfort in newfound rapport with this beautiful young lady. "Ah, quite right, I daresay." He drew in a long heady breath of perfumed city summer air. "One never gets to relive those first moments twice, mm? That's the bittersweet nature of finally arriving home..." He lit himself the spliff he'd recently procured from a crystal bowl under the live-awning. Inhaling deeply, he closed his eyes to fully savor the ecstasy of this delicious moment in time, allowing the smoke and fleeting sensations of the day to suffuse his consciousness without visual disturbance. 

Exhaling, he concluded, "In that sense - you really can never go home again..."

When he opened his eyes, she was gone.

-------

"Ha ha ha ha if they play that song one more time I'm going to **bite** somebody." remarked a slightly-less-unremarkable-than-usual Sentinel standing cornered between a waste bin and a lamp post, taking full advantage of the din to keep his words from all but the most attentive of ears, and masking them further with a gaping, saccharine smile.

One would be forgiven for mistaking this particular officer of the city for part of the performing troupe with his large and pointed ears, fur-covered face, and the telltale pale blue glow in his eyes that marked him as one of the crystal-blessed beastfolk of the eastern woodlands. Several already had, despite him being in full uniform and stood aside from the thick throng along the immaculate new platform.

"If you good people could start getting rowdy and give me an excuse to begin bashing your heads together that would be fan**tastic**." he went on to say as he treated the doe-eyed child of a pointing parent to a flawlessly regal wave and clicked his tongue against one of his sizable fangs in relief when the youngster's short-spanned attention sent them both scurrying elsewhere.

"...How long until next rotation."

-------

"I'm beginning to see merit in these complaints of favoritism," came the stern response from an equally stern looking woman as she stepped in beside him from the crowd.

She too was in uniform, but hers was the sleek, fresh spidersilk craft ordered for this occasion. It matched her militant posture well. Human, mostly, with red hair pulled back in a short ponytail to show off the markers of her mixed ancestry-- dark patterned spots lining her temple and working their way down her neck and disappearing beneath the high collar of the celebratory uniform.

"There's an occupancy needing filled on the Beeliner security force," she explained succinctly, "You're with me."

Then, with the barest hint of a smile that most would claim imagined, she said, "Unfortunately, you'll have to remain in Sentinel regalia.'

-------

He loosed a low whistle loud enough to draw curious eyes from nearby revelers, "Don't try to tell me you've still got favours left to leverage, Spots. Who'd you put in the Medbay for that? **Randal?** Hassiri? Randal? Please tell me it was Randal."

-------

"I am not at liberty to discuss the circumstances of the change," she replied in deadpan, green eyes unyielding. 

The crowd surged around them, largely unseeing of the two city protectors.

After a few more beats of stoic professionalism, as if entirely unrelated, she struck up conversationally as she prepared to dive once more into the throng: "I hear Randal needed to straighten out a clerical error in his health assessment. Until he does so, he's ineligible for out-Beacon deployment. Do you see that woman?" 

The redhead nodded subtly to the well dressed lady taking hasty leave of the rambling drunkard, "Note that one, and behave yourself if you cross paths." She eyed her companion sidelong briefly, "I mean it."

-------

Down the tracks, past the clamorous proletariat and panting chimney of the restless railcar, Rusalka stirred the cooling xuxonite cubes around the last of the muddled mint in her cup. It seemed she'd finally shook off the babbling drunkard in his decades-old pinstripe clownsuit. Above her sun-haloed hair, colorful streamer fringe danced in the breeze.

At the other end of the mulling, purposeless procession, this same breeze tickled a cherry red ribbon shimmying across the train's filgreed cab door, never before opened to the public. The breeze went on to caress the capped head of finely dressed eventgoer who sported an immaculate mustache and an only slightly less elegant belly. He was preoccupied, it seemed, dangling an oversized pair of jewel-encrusted scissors the size of a suitcase, embroiled in a heated discussion with a man a head taller and infinitely more garish. On the third gust of hot wind, the bowler hat was tipped clean off the smaller man's pate. As though suspecting some prankster at work, he whipped his head around this way and that, searching for the origin of the sensation before comically patting his head, then noticing his pricey ornament tumbling under the polished coupling rods of the huffing, muttering engine.

Hastily passing the scissors to the fellow with whom he'd been arguing moment's prior, he levered down to his silk-clad hands and knees, delicately leaning to peer between the train wheels, carefully shifting weight only to the soles of his shiny black shoes. Endeavoring to snatch the escaped hat settled on the track, he found - to his chagrin - that it was all too much - and went toppling. A slender long legged woman in a suitjacket and tiny skirt darted forward, catching him just pre-faceplant, but not soon enough to protect the knees of his trousers. Behind them, the tall, garish man guffawed, then directed his attention at the bandshell. He snapped his fingers a few times at the conductor. But the conductor's eyes were elsewhere.

-------

"You always mean it" said the uniformed bat, with gaze tracking the woman on the warpath with laser-like focus, "and I~ never listen."

Meanwhile, separated from all the pomp and ceremony of the occasion by little more distance than the span of the railcars themselves, an almost unbroken stream of workmen were still loading all manner of shipping containers into the train's multiple cargo carriages. Crates, kegs, barrels, and boxes of all sizes and odors making their way up access ramps to be crammed as tightly as they could be made to fit together for the coming voyage, with nary a watchful eye in sight - and why would there be? Such things went on at the rail station on a daily basis without cause for caution.

So far as it mattered to anyone not privileged enough to be part of the festivities, it was business as usual.

-------

Rusalka took one final sip from her cup and abandoned it, striding purposely forward. As she did so, the conductor met her eyes, beamed, and then squawked. The band changed its tune.

They began to play an upbeat disco-esque arrangement of, "Our Lady Auburn, Queen of the Rails".

Hailing the end of the 'smooth scat jazz' segment of the day's musical theme, this literal tone shift worked like a charm. All attention was immediately directed to the band, and then immediately after directed to the one the band was facing. The crowd parted as Rusalka sashayed along the platform, toward the band, toward the mustached man with scuffed trousers, toward his attractive assistant, and toward the tall one, who was dressed in red and gold brocade and an armload of bangles, holding a giant pair of scissors and still couldn't snag the band's attention from the current spectacle of Rusalka.
Just walking.

The mustached man, having recovered his hat, seemed also to have recovered his wits. He brushed down his besmirched suit and forcibly wrenched the scissors out of the tall man's hands. The tall man bristled, fists clenching. His eyes wished blight on the back of the short man's perfectly capped head.

The crowd was hushed. As Rusalka approached the men and assistant, the band, too, hushed, so all could hear them speak.

"Welcome to the brand new home of the Beacon-Drosera Railway!" bellowed the tall man suddenly.
All heads turned to the tall man. Rusalka paused midstride. He'd taken the megaphone dangling beside the cab door while all eyes were on her.

"Today we celebrate the grand opening of this (2.5 hour) express rail line from this very special town to the new Drosera Thicket processing facility. We'd like to thank--"

Hereupon, Rusalka overcame surprise and rapidly closed the distance between herself and this topheavy brocade-clad oaf. Seeing this now, he extended a hand to her just as she arrived, "--my fellow council members, and in particular, Rusie Luyus - let's give her a hand, huh? She planned this whole thing. I mean, the music. All the polkas. You folks love polkas right?" He waggled his elbow at the crowd. Some laughed, others seemed conflicted. Rusalka was now toe to toe with him glowering up at his smug, rosie-cheeked face.
"Alright, alright everybody - little joke, just a little joke. Rusie's a great sport. We love her. Who doesn't? I mean...she isn't shy about loving people back, depending on how you define the word! Ohh, I'm just kidding, doll." The last was addressed to Rusalka directly, with a wink.

"Aaanyway, yadayadayada, what I'm here to say is that this rail, sponsored by my guys at Sunshine Corps, are really pleased you could all make it out today to see our baby, this beautiful train we've been building for you, for the businessmen, for the future of our great nations, begin its long career of service." He reached for the giant jeweled scissors then, but Rusalka ripped them out of the little man's grasp quicker, and held them, momentarily, open as she smiled with ferocious charisma at the unblinking upstager.

Incidentally, the scissor blades were level with his lower extremities. She reached for the megaphone. "That's about all there is to say about the train, but here's Rusie Luyus with a little standup comedy," he concluded.

-------

"Waste me." the bat muttered as the MC had barely gotten into his opening remarks, mindful to keep his voice low now that the commotion had died down. He looked to his partner in crime prevention with a frown, "Bossman, I had a songbird lined up to bring me a juicy worm not long after this shin-ding wound down. I gotta get a line to her to move up the timetable if I'm going to be out of the city the rest of the day."

He had already angled his back towards the end of the platform and was taking his first few back-trotting steps in that direction as he aimed his thumb over his shoulder.

-------

The tall man grinned again at the crowd and handed over the megaphone gently. Then stepped away from Rusalka & the giant scissors, covering his bottom and pantomiming nervous glances over his shoulder. A few folks in the crowd chuckled.

Rusalka, deadpan, swooshed up in an impressive fluttering of feathered hairpieces and proceeded undeterred.
"Why, Councilman Calhoun, your modesty is overwhelming."

She smiled at the crowd, rutilant jewels and glitter shimmering against the morning sun. The masses gazed wretchedly back. Old women in babushkas, snot nosed toddlers in frilly pinafores now tugging on belt loops to go home, self-congratulatory sneers of trophy wives, beer-bellied working men scratching themselves and sniggering. No one here would know a good time if it went home with them for a week. They'd all let a good time sleep on the floor while they took the bed.

"What comes now is no joke, people. This train, the Beeliner, is your one and only firstclass ticket to a life few of you ever imagined. To experiences few folks are bold enough to grasp. You're all safe now. In this familiar, comfortable little town. Some of us," she smiled at Calhoun, "Believe it's all within our control. Our lives are quiet now...like a sensory deprivation chamber. Have you been listening? No music. Polka isn't music. Our view here is monochrome." She gestured around and let that sink in. The crowd's energy seemed to sink with it. The little mustached man twisted his handkerchief in his fingers, tapping his toes inside their shiny black shoe.

Rusalka's clear voice cracked down on them like lightning. "Have you wanted color? Have you wanted noise? New, delicious, tastes? Have you been dancing narrowly on a very...crowded...floor?

"This train's for you. The world awaits. The Beeliner leaves now!"

She twirled and cut the ribbon!

-------

"If you miss the launch," the woman warned, her stride unhindered towards the Beeliner as Razor peeled off, "I will never forgive you."

The woman hauled herself into a rail car, bypassing the congested loading ramp, and disappeared within the dark interior without so much as a backwards glance at the bat-kin. They both had work to do.

-------

His response was a broad shrug and an expression that wordlessly begged the question "what can I do?" Then the uniformed batm'n spun around and hastened his way to the end and down from the platform, firing a quick look to the left, then turning right and scooting away behind the tail car of the train. He eyeballed the porters still moving cargo aboard as he passed; only a few cases left. A smile creased his thin lips, giving a peek at the upper left of his prominent fangs. Cutting it close. Just the way he liked it.

In short order he was tucked just around the corner of one of the supporting pillars for the canopy over the railyard, out of sight from prying eyes, if only just. He was already halfway out of his patrolman's coat, split between unfastening the last few buttons with one hand while the other arm already wriggled and twisted to extract itself from its sleeve.

Prompted by something imperceptible he inquired, "Were you able to get everything?"

-------

"I--Yes, I do believe so" says a small shadow, perched on the top of one of the pillars. The robes it wears, though modest and made of soft, pastel browns and whites, has been made with plenty of care and love
A constant clickety-clickety-clack can be heard as the tiny thing climbs down with surprising swiftness for something so small-- Although back up there it was hard to tell at a first glance, now that they're moving it's quite simple to tell that this being has more than one pair of legs they're moving atop of.

From underneat the cloack, two fuzzy, tiny hands in white and orange produce perfectly-folded civilian clothes in Razor's size, down to a tee. They're all together in a lovely square, tied with a little silken bow atop... underneath which is a dagger with a curved blade. "I ah, I thought this may come in handy. It's never too good to be too safe, yes-yes?" Their voice feels raspy and forcedly muted down, as if they were scared of talking too much.

They raise their arms to make it easier for the man to handle the clothing, and the robe slips just a little down their arm-- which is black as coal in comparison. They lower both as soon as they notice, and mutter an apologetic "I'm so sorry"

Gosh, why him out of all people? Shouldn't the actual representative be here? All they said is that they weren't available and that, as the second-in-line for such duties they were supposed to attend in his stead, but.. Ourgh. Of course he'd miss out on something like this! Frukka always loves to skip all the stuff that'd be "boring" to him. He should have planned as much

-------

While the arachnid was loathe to permit even such a small amount of its body to be exposed, the bat was ... clearly of the opposite persuasion, barely having discarded his up-until-then prestine jacket in the dirt beneath him and already dropping his trousers. His pale blue gaze fell upon the blade as he straightened back up, sounding his approval with a sharp click made by his tongue striking upon a fang.

"If you're trying to earn a fat bonus you're on the right track, kid." he said with a grin as he took the whole parcel off his accomplice's hands. Peeling apart the carefully-folded sleeves and leggings revealed the ledger hidden away within, and still having yet to even begin redressing himself the bat first began scanning the documents it contained, flipping forward and back repeatedly through its few thin pages. The more he went back and forth, the more his frown seemed to deepen, until all at once he leveled a cheerful smile on the shorter-statured being and dropped the ledger and knife atop his piled uniform.

"So! Ever ridden a train before?" the bat asked, and immediately set about donning the matching black leather jacket and slacks that had just been delivered to him.

-------

The engineer sits at a dining booth table outside the cargo bay, shuffling through a dense stack of legal-format papers with a look of bafflement that often accompanies his current blood-alcohol saturation; the reactions of attractive, charismatic women; and postsecondary maths. These things being as they were, for Harris Humes the expression was most immediately a reaction to elementary math.

The numbers on the papers didn't match the cargo in the bay. But he couldn't call anyone on it. Outside the window, he noted that the mustached station supervisor was glancing fretfully between gods' gift to man and the tall gilded clown who'd tusseled with that gift over the scissors (this Harris observed when he first exited the cargo bay and pulled apart the luxurious silk drapes, to check the status of the day's proceedings). He couldn't interrupt the speech, unfortunately. Not with this whole crowd watching. Bad enough he wasn't manning the helm - he was expected to be ready for action at this point on the formal itinerary. Instead, he was way back in the lavish dining car fustling through inventory logs and drumming his fingers over a minor clerical error.

But what if it was not just a clerical error? What if cargo was being shipped to the wrong destination? A box full of genetically engineered labradoodles for the dutchess of Kroug? 

Or--what if this was a trap? What if that creep Franko had deliberately planted the wrong items aboard this critical, high profile first run - out of envy? 

Clutching his fists unconsciously, Harris finally recalled that moment when the Board chose _Harris_, over all other engineers, young and old, over even Franko - widely considered the best - to steer this monumental ride on its historic journey. Damn it--of _course_ it was Franko's doing!

Harris knew then that he had to tell someone - report this before it ruined his career! In a myopic daze, he leapt to his feet and barrelled toward the door--

Rusalka gathers her three feathery gilded ruby skirts to mount the stairs, opening the freshly deribboned cab door and stepping inside --

Full body slamming right into none other than the blue pinstriped idiot from before. The impact causes her to tumble sidelong and topple to the floor, as his foot remained dumbly anchored on one of her elegant skirts, jerking it out from under her sanguine mothfluff-trimmed bodice. Breaking her fall with her hands, her many skirts were cast askew, the long layers snaking high up to her henna-painted thigh, revealing - only momentarily - a most peculiar looking device clamped among the garters on her leg.
Suddenly she jerked her skirt over it. Harris' hapless eyes rose reluctantly to meet her own venemous gaze, ablaze with unbridled fury.

Then a torrent of passengers came pouring in to the cabin like a school of salmon making for the promised land.

Rusalka stood in an instant and was gone - limping away before anyone likely even noticed she'd stumbled.

Dumbfounded, Harris searched for her departing figure in the crowd for several moments, jostled this way and that by the flood of bodies stirring past. Wishing he could rewind time. The clatter of someone brushing by the papers out of his hand awakened him from this stupor.

-------

Others would have felt shy, awkward even! About an adult man just going stark-dang-naked in front of them-- but either _this_ specific Sciame is super cool with it, or spiders as a whole don't... mind clothing too much. Guess it's not as important without family jewels to cover, eh?

The idea of a bonus sounds... nice? He really isn't doing anything that he wasn't asked to do by those above him, really-- and he only added the knife as an after-thought, pondering over the implications and risks that his "colleague" is bound to find on his own quest. 
"...Wait what di-- excuseme? What did you say?"

...Ride the train? The-- the BeeLiner? They uh, they didn't _think_ there'd be... more to this! Wasn't he supposed to just Give the parcel, and nothing else? Just do this, go somewhere else, mmmaybe have lunch before heading home?

"...I guess I haven't?"

-------

"I asked if you've ever gotten to ride on one of these trains before." Razor said, jerking his thumb over his shoulder in the general direction of the one that was probably going to start pulling out any moment now, following the errand bug's answer with a new question, "Had any practice fighting hand to hand? Think you could take a human down without killing them?"

-------

"N-no? No to the uh to the uh train question."

He lights up a little at the last question "We regularly hunt for food-- I have some training for such occasions. Um, I think I could... handle my strength? I uh"

He wrings his hands together, for a bit. One step (Three? He Does have six legs) back.

"Is... I didn't _know_ I'd have to, uh, do battle."

-------

"I'm not saying you _will_ have to." the bat said with all the same cheer he's thus far addressed the spider using, stooping and, from amongst the disheveled pile of his belongings, retrieving the dagger, his firearm, and his badge. He was still smiling when he straightened up, tucking each into the inside of his jacket, which evidently had some space for stowing and concealing such things. He then pulled on his collar, and at the bottom seam of the jacket, inspecting it for any telltale creases or bulges that might hint at its hidden occupants, looking all the more pleased to find none.

"I just wanted to know how worried about you I'd need to be if _I_ get into a fight." he added only then, after he was finished attending to himself, loosing another enthusiastic click, "Well? I'm ready if you are!"

-------

The person who'd shoved past was gone before he knew what happened, yet the sound and motion jostled Harris out of his crestfallen stupor. With renewed intention, the tremulous engineer scooped up the papers and made way against the moshing tide toward the door. The walkable space was narrow, a channel of resentful stares parted in waves until finally the next resentful stare belonged to Rumphus, the station manager, who entered the cab.

The mustachiod man stuttered like a lit fuse making its way to the payload. "Humes! Why in gods' names aren't you manning the blasted helm?! Do you know the time?!"

"Yes, uh. Yes, I do, sir. Very much so. But you see, ehm, there's a....." Just then he noticed one of his papers was missing. He looked at the papers. Then back to Rumphus. "...slight problem?"

Rumphus' mustache twitched. "I should say so! Why are we talking, man? Aren't you commissioned to man a historic vessel in, oh," he glanced at his brass sundial watch which showed no time because they were indoors and, anyway, was mostly a posh fashion statement, then concluded, "2 minutes?"

"There was miscount - with the inventory -" Harris blurted, finding words suddenly to be a struggle.

His words were cut short as Rumphus coughed and swatted the air between them. "You reek of seltzer and cherries, man! Enough rambling! Let's get you to your post before anyone smells your breath and the whole thing is off!" With this, he shoved Harris' skinny body aside. "And for the love of the Guiding Beam, try to sober up!"

 He bustled away in the same direction Rusalka had gone.

-------

The spider stays still for a minute that feels like a year to him... And perhaps his accompanyment, depending on how hyper they are.
"I... Dont think I want to go? Im sorry sir? All I- All I knew is that I had to deliver this, because Somethin was up with the train and uh, my superior wasn't around, um."
Their tiny hands grasping at the hems of his cloak, head bowed, they continued "Its... Not like I Couldn't fight. I don't... I don't want to, sir. The Holy Mother wouldnt approve-- violence is only to be used as a defense, and hunting for food"

The arachnid looks up to Razor, eyes hidden under his cloak yet shining enough to notice a few of them, sparkling like coins in a wishing well. "Why do I have to -- why would I, lend you my hands? Whats, uh, so bad about this train-thing?"

-------

"Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey, easy." batcop coos, hands raised as if in surrender, "I'm not asking you to do anything you wouldn't want to."

He turns his head aside, swipes his thumb up the middle of his nose and clicks his tongue once in a softer, thoughtful way, remarking in a quieter - though not so quiet as to escape the ears of his associate - voice, "They really did send me a kid -- I thought he was just _short_." When he faces the spider again, his expression suggests he still hasn't quite worked out how to deal with this... situation he has in front of him, but he's smiling confidently all the same. Then he squats down on his haunches like a true Slav so that he's closer to level with the hooded arachnid's lowest set of eyes.

"I don't know. Maybe nothing's bad about it at all. I need to be _absolutely sure_ about that, though, and that means going places people might not want me going, and asking questions people might not want me asking, and I'm not going to make you or anyone else to put your neck on the line with me. I can handle myself." Razor says, and never once does he sound less than completely convinced of his own awe-inspiring greatness, "The reason I'd like you to come along is to see for yourself whatever it is that I dig up. If everything's fine, great! If there's trouble, I want you to be able to get the warning out as quick as you're able. That's all."

-------

"Mister Humes," the quiet voice behind the befuddled engineer was somehow both sympathetic and severe; acknowledging that yes, this whole affair was a really a bother and she was witness to his suffering, but so too did she have her duties- they all had their part to play- so how could she help insofar as her own duties required without enabling him to shirk his own. Really, the woman's voice was quite expressive in so few words, should one really care to listen.

Her expression was blank, impervious, humanoid features purposefully taking a back seat to the myriad of mixed ancestry spots framing her face in dark browns and pale blacks. She waited on his response-- waiting for others to fill in the gaps usually served the reticent guard well.

-------

"Oh, good evening," replied Harris, pausing only momentarily to glance over his shoulder at her. "Am I in the way here? I'm so sorry - I was just heading that way." His started ahead down the narrow, crowded aisle, heart pounding in his stomach, toes tingling at the sound of her stern, chilling voice.

Quickly moving to put some distance between the officer and his incriminating breath, he bustled along but called over his shoulder, "I hope it's been a good day for you out there - you guys are working hard! Really the city's finest. An honor to have you aboard, ma'am!"
The train whistle hooted just then, impatient as a tapping foot. Who on earth was blowing the whistle? That was _his_ job!

He scrambled toward the engineering room as best he could, walking with unusual haste. "Sorry -" he called as he fled. He would have concluded, but instead felt his diaphragm spasm from all the anxiety and only narrowly avoided finishing his statement with a loud hiccup.

-------

Hmm. Well, the spider thinks to himself, theres is reason in his words.

After all from all hes been able to gather, what possible reason could these people have to create a direct line to the Drossera Thicket? Surely its not a cultural exchange, because the Sciamii living there don't... Really have one, that isn't survival. They wouldn't destroy the thing, either-- after all thatd take a lot of effort for perhaps no result except the death of thousands and the loss of a biological miracle

Now, exploiting it for all its worth, sucking it bones dry and throwing its inhabitants out, as such creating chaos amongst them an others?

Yeah. Yeah that feels likely.

The spider takes a few steps and stops short of Razor, and tends his hand to him. "If I am to accompany you, I ought introduce, uh, myself. My name is Lekkra"

... And as soon as the man takes his hand, he utters "And I am no child-- I have sired and fostered several spiderlings of my own". Which he says way more confident than... Anything else, thus far

-------

"Razor." the officer introduces himself in turn, taking the offered hand in his own with only a moment's hesitation and twice easing back from the initial firm squeeze he applies to it. Bugs are so easy to ... break, when they're not people-sized, after all, can't exactly fault one for expecting that frailty to carry over to a lifted being.

"No kidding?" he asks with an impressed-toned click when his new partner offers up the deets of their personal life, "Well damn, now I _have_ to make sure nothing bad happens to you. Remind me next time to specify that they _don't_ send me a family man, Pops."

The words have barely left his mouth when the whistle sounds, and the bat practically yanks his hand away in turning to peer around their makeshift cover in the direction of the train. A look over his shoulder to Lekkra follows, then a motion bidding the arachnoid to follow. He trots the first few paces around the pillar but soon breaks to a sprint at the sight of the labourers getting ready to close up the last of the freight carriages.

"Cutting this a bit closer than I'd planned!" he uttered and then, waving a hand as high over his head as he could stretch it, called ahead, **"Hey! Hold that door! Official Sentinel business!"**

-------
Train-shaped cocktail in hand, Rusalka pivoted as the cab door eclipsed her view of a furry blue fellow in uniform & diminutive cloaked figure scuttling toward the action. Just as well. They were both underdressed.

'The Action' toward which they'd been haplessly running presently consisted of 3 human and anthropomorphic beastfolk individuals identifying as women, dressed in deflated, knock-off pre-Act 0.5 neoregency fashion with roccoco accents, all cooing and twittering over Rusalka's hot new mothfluff collar.  Vivian, a tall (but not tall enough), luscious (but not luscious enough) fellow garbed in a wool-padded gossamer doublet and oversized purple coat which opened at the front revealing holographic glitter smeared all down his chest, chuckled as a fawning smaller, paler lad kissed some of the silver glitter off of his beard and the three women looked at Rusalka, who smiled, and they, too, smiled. Something in that smile made them uneasy. Had they done something to upset her?

Another aspect of The Action consisted of the event's house band, who - in lieu of Rusalka's emergency replacement act showing up prior to the Beeliner's slow building of momentum - struggled over basic knowledge of electroclash / nu disco instrumentation given that most of their tools were brass & acoustic. 

Sipping demurely from her smoldering beverage, Rusalka locked kohl-rimmed eyes with the only other person who seemed to notice this anomaly: Wyntres Thie. 

On the opposite side of the crowd, the shirtless, bejeweled, glitter-covered redhead perched against a handrail, bobbing his head rhythmically and picking through a miniature caboose stuffed with candybread. This long, tall drink of strawberry milk was as sophisticated as he was hard on the eyes. Noting the newfound spotlight, he froze mid-chomp. Now the slight widening of his pretty blue eyes suddenly seemed to register a question.

_Where is my band?_ her smile demanded.

He glanced sheepishly at the door, then back at her, blinking, setting aside the cup of treats, but shoving a few into his tremendously oversized colorblock pockets.

Since you asked, yes, he was selected because he matched her decor, thank you for noticing. And yes, he could carry both she & her baggage when her feet ached from new & elegant shoes. Certainly, alright, was he an accomplished tattooist and, why not?, a metalsmith of reasonable note. And yet. And yet, this now all too evident penchant for polkas (among a sea of equal but noiseless abominations), rendered it clear that the boy lacked scope. As each of the day's arduous moments drifted past, the closer he drifted toward transfer to the Wastes Ops.


-------

The BeeLiner keeps gettin' faster, there really isn't time to completely catch up on foot and not by a lack of will or energies-- its the fact that the speed is just unmatchable by them.

That's when, after takin' a few slower strides to prepare, from behind the furred man the spider leaps-- Rrrright on top of his chest, face-front. All legs like a vicegrip on both sides, his hands take a grip on the collar of his shirt as he twists back, lookin' at his bullseye.

"Hold on tight!" can be heard in a grunt of a shout, almost drowned in the sounds of the train's engine as Lekkra shoots a finely-aimed silk rope at the train, with just enough speed to latch right where the door touches the wall atop-- enough space to cross over the railing, if they do it right!

As he pulls back the rope and tries to get them across ("Sweet Holy Mother this Hurts", "I'm going to strain -something-" and "My god my god I'm exercising muscles I really didn't think I Had doing this with someone Heavy is fucking Strange" being three of the several thoughts crossing his mind currently) he says, though perhaps not loud enough to be heard-- "I guess choosing to study rather than go hunting _did_ pay off in the end, huh!"

-------

As the train rocked with gathering steam, Rusalka's pride sank & rage swelled. The crowd of partygoers cheered. Train-shaped poppers spurted shining tendrils of synthethetic bioluminsecent plantmatter skyward, heels were clicked in the customary acknowledgement of collective triumph. Libations flowed with renewed vigor & dancing grew more aggressive. Equally bad, but faster now. In honor of this, the house polka band continued to play the same ditty of didactic but "plucky" nationalistic fervor: '_My Beacon Thinks He’s a Train_'. WHERE WAS HER GODS. DAMNED. BAND? 

Clutching the rim of her beverage flute more tightly with each drum hit, she studied the cab door with a tightening jaw, & the smoldering liquid in her cup drifted toward a bergamot-coated rim.
 
Wyntres reeled from his perch & closed the distance between them, tipping the cup upright just in time to spare the powdercoated dyes of her spidersilk ensemble from liquid death.

"You don't like the decorations?" he whispered, furtively glancing about. Noting her wordless glance at his fingers (still frozen over hers), he shoved into his hands into his pockets.

_Oh yes. The decorations._

"Trains, huh." Without acknowledging his gaze, she tossed back a slow, deliberate drink.
There were trains everywhere. Paper trains on the walls of the train. Tiny train-shaped confettis. 
The house band knew just one disco song. The one they'd played for Rusalka's commencement speech, & it was train themed. That song was only thing that Rusalka, personally, saw fit to request for this dry & tawdry event planning ordeal of banal train-hype. Trains! She was supposed to get hyped about trains?! She'd given it to the only person she knew could get hyped about trains - when he'd shyly offered - and now...

And now this.
This.

"BAM!" announced the cab door, directing everyone to turn.

-------

The red-headed Sentinel ducked back from the side of the railcar when the sting of the rushing air became uncomfortable. The back of the engine car shielded her. It was alarming between cars, but exhilarating all the same. 

Sheathing a chilly earlobe in her gloved hand, she watched the familiar Beacon Sprawl as the Beeliner gained speed. It was a first in a life time view. She switched ears and distractedly fished into a pocket, bewitched by the familiar from such an unfamiliar viewpoint.

In her palm was a small, decorated spiralling shell, oplascent, attached to a small red ribbon. She lifted it to her face and cupped it protectively from the whipping wind, then spoke softly to it:

"The Beeliner...I am overwhelmed by its future of peace and cultural understanding. I wish...you could have seen this with me. It's fast, and smells like heat and oil."

She held the shell up, careful to keep it in hand, and let the ambient noise surround it. Then, with a sigh, she pocketed the trinket and stepped inside the car behind the engine.

-------

Razor shouts a remark or two about the lack of diversity in the highborn gene pool at the back of the departing train, pushing his legs to carry him as fast as they can be forced to do so, when it suddenly feels like a large sack of potatoes has struck him in the back. He barely saves himself from falling face first on the tracks in the moments that follow, struggling with the added weight as it moves itself around to the front of his body and, almost faster than he can process what's going on, he finds himself in an eight-legged embrace.

"**Drinks first!**" he blurts out in a way that seems strangely reflexive, right at the same moment the arachnoid is warning him to hold on, "Wait, what?"

Then the bat's eyes grow incredibly wide, looking on in awe as his new favourite partner lassos the train and launches them at it. With its butt. The seconds that follow become something of a blur for the pair, mostly owing to inertia and the spin the Sentinel puts them in towards the end of their arc, each moment punctuated by manic laughter, whooping, and finally the sensation of hard, unforgiving metal colliding with flesh and bone. Razor's, specifically. He had managed to set up that spin so that he'd be between the bug and the train when they hit it. Anyway that's what he's going to tell everyone his intent was, if they ask later.
As he crumples down to the floor of the rear balcony he pushes out a few more weary, winded laughs, rolling his head back and to the side, his eyes twinkling with something a little more than the usual crystal-hued glow. Then, with a sharp inhale to help steady his bearings, he levels the biggest grin he can stretch his mouth into at Lekkra.

"That was the best thing I have ever done." he declares, and with disconcerting speed reins his enthusiasm back to its usual level, "See, Pops? I couldn't pull this off without you. Now we just need to get up to the freight cars for a peek to make sure nothing's amiss, but to do that we're going to have to get through..."

Suddenly, the man-bat's face is grim, his eyes seem deeper-sunken and surrounded by impenetrable shadow, despite the persistent light they give off, his tone dropping an octave as he finishes, "**The Beeliner Gala.**"

-------

Rusalka sets down her train cup.
The polka grinds to a laboured halt.
Everything is still for a moment before the wind now - rippling the spiderfuzz and cloak of the sciame kid - shimmying the bluish fur of the uniformed bat bloke - whipping through the cabin, via the open railcar door, scattering napkins, plates and pasties - snatches one of the rare firebird plumes from Rusalka's extraordinary hair adornment.

She opens her mouth in protest against the wind, but any sad quiet sound she makes is swallowed by the howl of the open cab door behind the two newcomers.

Before anyone else can react, she announces, "Oh good, the band's here." And jerks her head at Wyntres to close the door.

-------

It may have been the sudden ammount of people in front of him (Never quite the public speaker); perhaps the sudden realization of, hey, this IS dangerous? He only had to... give a parcel, and that's it.  Nothing else! No more help required, just another one of those dumb tasks they make him do so often! All right!! 

Maybe it's the enclosed space? The risk of firearms and stray bullets, because even if he Does evade any sort of danger who's to say he won't become secondary damage? Perhaps it's the sudden smell of danger in the air?

He takes a few steps back, afraid-- "I'll uh I'll uh I'll go through the top! I can rea--reach you further on ahe--!" And the door closes, right in front of his face.
Welp.

Guess he IS going through the top, after all

-------

Razor is left sitting alone on the floor staring at the pointlessly elaborate brass detailing on the inside of the door, expression blank, eyes blinking rapidly.

"I ... guess I should have just said it would be horribly boring." he says to no one particular and proceeds to pick himself up, brush off his outer thighs and seat of pants, wipe a stray, leftover strand of webbing off his shoulder ... or, rather, wipe his hand over a strand of webbing on his shoulder and spend another three or so minutes just standing there struggling to separate it from either his jacket or his palm. The final result is a ripping sound, a wince, and him gingerly rubbing the defurred palm of his hand as he at last turns to make his way up the carriage. For a mercy, by then the initial surprise that had captivated the crowd on his entry has subsided and he only has to contend with the odd blueblood looking at him as if he were some vomit-reeking drunkard and, they being aristocrats and him being Felemelte, he was fully accustomed to that.

He helps himself to one of those tacky train-shaped beverages off the first server he can weave his way over to, gives it a once-over with a face that pretty much screams "rich folk amirite," tips it back for a heaping swig and lets his jaw lower along with the glass so the drink spills right back in, and sneaks the affront to taste back onto the tray of a different server he slips past further up the car, shuddering and contorting his features through a myriad of disgusted expressions. All without ever breaking his stride.

-------

"May I help you?" enquires a voice, coolly, from behind - just as he's reaching the exit.
The voice - haughty, commanding and wryly coquettish, all at once - belongs to Rusalka. She faces the furry blue man, eyebrow arched. One elegant lace gloved hand rests on her hip, an empty train goblet adorns the other. "You seem lost."

Scurrying silently up behind her, Wyntres presents his mistress with the recovered firebird plume. She exchanges it for her empty train goblet without so much as regarding the man. Wyntres recedes back into the sweaty morass of painted gyrating bodies behind her and dissolving into glitter and spasmodic lights.

-------

"I get that a lot." Little Bat Blue says without a trace of facetiousness, followed by a thoughtful-toned cluck of his tongue, brought to a halt but moving his eyes in such a way as would suggest he's constantly charting and recharting his course to the door, sparing the woman directly in front of him only a quick once over. Suddenly, he's snapping his fingers repeatedly, his face brightened with excitement.

"Oh _you're_...!  Wastes, it's left me. Lady something? Ladyyy ... _The Bee Lady_."

He only finally meets her gaze her once he's dumped the moniker in her lap, wearing a smile that would brand him as the Village Idiot, proceeding directly into a ramble without pause, gesticulating energetically the whole while,  "I mean obviously that's not your name but that's what I keep hearing people call you and _**wowza** you are killing it in that dress_ is that genuine Sciame spider silk or did they weave it from clippings of that gorgeous hair of yours because if I may say I have never seen hair that looked so smooth and healthy and the way it frames your face oh madam you are a work of _art_--"

...This will continue, if permitted.

-------

As he speaks, Rusalka casually re-nests the firebird plume in her elaborate hairdo. 

"Why don't you play us a song?" Rusalka volunteered, jutting her delicate porcelain chin toward the diamond-encrusted bandstage, where the polka continued undeterred. She lowered her lashes at him...it was clearly a challenge, a dare.

-------

This! Gets the bat to pause mid-blather, look at the stage, then back to Rusalka, his face frozen in the look of insipid reverie he was wearing when she interrupted him. Then, a bubbly, vapid laugh as he gestures dismissively in her direction, "Well no one mentioned _The Bee Lady_ had such a clever sense of humour, imagine, for moment there I thought you'd actually mistaken me for part of the entertainment. Instead of _The Bee Lady_ they should call you The Jerker Bee Lady, get it? Like _worker bee_ but _jerk_ because you just _jerked_ my chain!"

-------

"You're a funny boy," Rusalka replied, plucking a piece of glitter off the lapel of his uniform. "I like that...in a bat. Bee Lady's a new one for me. Did you come up with that yourself? Have you ever considered a career in standup?" She searched his face tenderly. "No? Perhaps you needed a little prompting. You see, I need less...polka...and you need less...getting fired, am I right?" Creasing her delicate brow, as though puzzled, she added - "Unless you think your supervisor would be understanding about why you crashed a 16K-cluster historic gala fete with a cloaked spider...that is."

Just then, Wyntres returned with a freshly filled train caboose goblet. It was red and smoldering with dried ice or...gods knew what. She took the glass and waved him off, with a gesture that seemed part wave, part gang sign. 

Then she took a long red sip out of the crimson goblet, fixing her gaze pointedly on the bat lad through a veil of alcoholic smoke. The warm tones of liqueur reflected in her wry gray eyes. Oh, I see - the drink was actually on fire.

She seemed nonplused by it as she sipped. And more miraculously still - her lipstick remained immaculate. What devilry was this?!

-------

"Gh-h-h."

The airhead act finally drops as the bat scrunches and contorts his face into a look somewhere between repulsed and intrigued, while his ears twitch and flick spastically. On the one hand, she totally just took a pass back at him. On the other, she followed it right up with a threat. Also, his Danger Sense has been going off since the moment he met her gaze. She can probably hear the gears in his head grinding as he forcibly smooths out his features and leers at her through the vapor coming off her beverage.

"...I can do magic."

-------

Eerily coincident with Razor's proclamation, the manservant Wyntres comes strutting back, this time ushering some conical hornlike item along with him. Just this once, Rusalka momentarily acknowledges his presence with a curt smile, and takes the...uh oh. Oh no.

Ever efficient with gestures, Rusalka's body follows her head in a pivot toward Wyntres. Toward the sweaty, glittering throngs of neon bodies shimmying and coiling.

She lifts the horn to her mouth and --

**DOOT DOO DOOOOO WAHHHHHHHHHHHH!**

The polka falls silent. Guests, including those who'd been playfully tossing black train-shaped confetti at one another, fall still.

They are looking at Rusalka.

They are looking at the man behind her.

**"It appears, ladies and gentlemen, that one of our honored guards dropped into the party...a little tardy."**

**"OoOoOoOoOohhhh!"** cries the crowd.

Reaching behind her, Rusalka snakes an arm around Razor's lower back and gives him a hefty shove forward.

**"I know! That's very naughty, isn't it?!"**

The crowd cheers in unanimous affirmation.

**"What do you think we should do with naughty lads who are late? Shall we have him perform a trick?"**

**"WAHHHH!!"** agrees the sweaty, shiny morass, clearly ecstastic over the suggestion.

Oh dear. They must really hate that godsawful music, too... Rusalka thinks grimly -- but stops herself just in time to keep her brow from creasing. She beams at them all. Well let's make them forget about it, shall we?

With that, she gives Razor another -- surprisingly muscular?! -- shove forward.

Even if this is terrible...well, it's bound to be all the more amusing...! ♡

-------

He'd assumed she'd summoned the horn expecting him to play it per her original 'challenge,' so the initial reaction was confusion when she got ready to blow on it herself, and then... Loud. Pain. The bat flinches and raises a finger towards his ear on a reflex to plug the hole and muffle the noise, but never quite makes it there. In the following moments he appears in a daze, blinking slowly, making very slight tilts and turns of his head. The boisterous trumpeting had overloaded his echolocation. For Razor, it was like a star had burst into existence scarcely more than arm's length away from his face, consuming the room and all that was in it in a blinding light which was now gradually fading away, forms and features bleeding back in from the void like myriad shifting fissures.

The first shove caught him still reeling, and he stumbled the couple steps forward before catching himself. He put on a sheepish smile and raised his hand in greeting to the assembled crowd, still cognizant of his situation enough to fill in the gaps. By the second thrust he has his bearings enough that he manages to save himself from completely bowling over the mustached gentleman in suspenders, barber stripes, and a monocle whom happens to be in his way. It's a crowded train. He spends a few moments mumbling profuse apologies while fussing with the fellow's attire, tugging its corners and patting down its surfaces all while repeatedly firing off quizzical looks at the multiple smaller lenses folded off to the side of the eyepiece. Were they for multiple levels of magnification? Or just decorative? What functional purpose could they ever -- focus.

------

He proceeds to bump and stumble his way through the crowd, barely passing a soul without colliding with them, grabbing onto each one to catch them - and himself - as he goes, straying wide of his target prompting the waiting and not-to-be-denied audience to right his course,  typically with shoves in the correct direction. Their is a quirk to his smile all the while that might lend, to the astute observe, the impression that encouraging these interactions are precisely his aim. Stalling? At long last he reaches the stage, back in full stride practically skipping the last few steps and scaling the platform with an effortless hop, spinning to face his audience, throwing his arms wide, then sweeping them behind his back and to his chest as he takes a deep bow.

"Esteemed guests! And our most esteemed hostess, _The Bee Lady!_" he proclaims, gesturing over the sea of heads towards Rusalka. The assortment of confused grunts and bewildered looks that accompany those many heads turning to search the crowd and, eventually, settle on the woman in red, puts the lie to his earlier claim that he heard the nom de plume from others - well, he never said it was the party guests, specifically. Razor sounds a delighted click as they gradually make the connection and turn back to him, the seed now planted.

"Let me just say, first of all, that it is a _privilege_ to be here with you all today on this historic..." the leather-clad bat begins, but trails off and starts gesturing for patience as the crowd begins to rumble impatiently, "Yes, ha ha, right... had enough speeches for one day, haven't we all. Just getting myself psyched up for this~"

"Actually... I could _really_ use a drink before I put on this show, bear with me! So sorry! I didn't exactly have a lot of time to get organized, y'know? You sir!" he points, quite dramatically, to a fellow nearest the stage, "Nearly done with that? Would you permit me have the rest and help yourself to a fresh drink from one of those fine servers? Oh, Spire thrice bless you, sir - that's what we Felemelte say when we're _especially grateful_, did you all know that?"

He keeps his voice raised to address the entirety of the cabin's occupants while he stoops down and takes the three quarters empty glass from the man, after first clasping both his hands around the other's free one and giving it a vigorous shaking. He gets ready to down the remaining beverage, then pauses and holds it up to eye level with a frown, "Actually that will really barely wet my whistle - ha, train joke, get it? Whistle? Like... on a train... ... ...hmm. But yes! You, ma'am! If you'd be so kind--oh, you would, Spire thrice bless, yes, _thank you_ so much."

And as before he squats to accept the drink, though he first of course must take the fine lass' hand in his and lift it to his face for a brief kiss that earns him little more than an eyeroll from her. He stands again, pours the second drink into the first, gets all set to toss the train-shaped decanter back and...

"_Actually--_"

A surge of groans and more than a few calls to "get on with it."

"Yes. Yes. It's just... it occurs to me this isn't really the sort of party for _sharing a kiss_ with two complete strangers! ...However _indirect_, is one of the servers... yeah! You there, this way. Let him through now~"

And soon on of those fellows toting a tray laden with untouched beverages waiting for thirsty guests is up at the stage and the bat is swapping his empty glass and mixture for one of the drinks.

-------

At some point in the bat's all-too-public fluster, the far door opened and the severe red-headed Sentinel mingled at the edge of the packed entertainment car.

'Mingled' was putting it kindly. She skirted the crowd as best she could as if they were contagious, gloved hands up to buffer herself from the thrall as she sidewinded and sidestepped and zigzagged through with mumbled, breathless apologies as she went. 

"_Actually-_", she hears, and the color in her face drained. Razor. In the Luyus' entertainment car. _In the spotlight_, with a literal stage beam highlighting the white of his fur to surreal luminosity. She stopped. 

She became a lanky, immovable bean pole of sober horrification, staring through the shifting leaves of limbs, accessories and impractical hairstyles, focused intently with the promise of dire consequence on the bat Sentinel.

-------

It's not rocket science - steering a train. Ya got a track. Ya got wheels. Ya got one way to go. Harris'd spent his life preparing. If there was one thing he knew in his sleep - eyes closed, hands tied behind his back - it was trains.

When he'd skittered up to the cool interior of the engineering room, he encountered some awful little tikes pounding their chubby baby fists on the horn like it was a clown car. He ran the little buggars off, feebly shaking his fist as they giggled & scampered down the hall out the engineering cab door. Harris looked after them, hastily settling into the driver's seat, then busied himself superficially. 

He expected the sentry would burst in from that same door & drag him away. He had to look functional, diligent...innocent. Yet after a few heart-in-throat moments, it seemed he was truly safe.

Wow. So here they were: he & the train of his boyhood dreams. In spite of all the obstacles. He'd made it. How was it that he'd ever so foolishly jeopardized this opportunity? & yet - & yet - who knew he'd be here one day? He heaved a stetterous sigh.

And hiccuped.

He discovered that they'd gotten the steering wheel all sticky with their candyclaws & smeared some kind of clay (?) goop on the chair. Tsking under his breath, Harris looked about for some sort of moisture to clean it, & in finding none, resolved to spitshine the marring with his old suitjacket. The Beeliner deserved better than this. He swabbed the wheel lovingly, like a maestro preparing to conduct a symphony. Doing so, his eyes drifted from the wheel to the desert-straddled track ahead & then to the painted shell on his dashboard. Harris fiddled a bit with the shell's opening until the mouth came just sufficiently ajar to keen out a little song. It was the song his old girl back home used to sing to him...before...

Just before.

```♪♫♬ & baby, I do-ooh until ahhhheee duoon't! ♪♫♬``` He silently mouthed the final lyrics of the chorus.

The Beeliner lurched into smooth & luscious motion.

-------

And so Razor takes a swig of his fresh new beverage! And shudders, contorts his face in disgust, puts the glass back, takes another, and repeats. And repeats. And repeats. And holds up his free hand gesturing for the crowd to wait just little more as he repeats. And repeats. And repeats. Until he's effectively contaminated the entire tray. Then, hanging onto the last decanter from which he sampled and letting out the remaining shivers, composes himself, takes a cleansing breath, and smiles oh so wide to the assembled masses.

"Now, at last, ladies and gentlemen - and The Bee Lady - today on this very stage, for the very first time, you shall witness... magic!" he declares, continuing over the protests of the gathered who are very much familiar with the arcane and are themselves practitioners, "And yes, I know what you're all thinking: _everyone knows magic, and absolutely nothing is special about a Felemelte that does magic at all_, and you would be correct - if I were talking about lighting a cigar or dousing the front row here in a fine mist."

For emphasis, he even lights up a small flame on his fingertip and makes a few flicking gestures to the aforementioned nobles nearest him as he grandstands, the droplets he conjured so small even those getting pelted with them don't see them so much as feel them upon their skin.

"No, what you are about to see is a magic so rare that it has yet to be documented! A magic so secret and with such potential to change life as we know it that I ... really shouldn't be doing this, actually, maybe I'll just..." the bat's voice beings to drop and he starts looking for a way down, earning a mixed reaction of encouraging cheers and jeers from those who see through his blatant attempt to weasel out of having to perform, until he motions once again for calm with a look of resignation.

"Alright, alright! After all, who am I to deny you good people your show! Just... keep this between us, alright?" he asks, with pleading, overly hopeful smile, to some mild chuckling, "Now all I need to proceed is something simple, like... a _watch_. So could I have a volunteer...? Great, thank you sir! No, no need to come up, if you could just pass me... haaah, I see that look. Nothing to fear, of course I wouldn't let it come to harm!"

Once the offered timepiece is in his possession, he stands tall to hold it up where all can see, the bat also craning his neck to look it over. It is, beneath all the ornamentation and frivolous details, less more than a sundial on a leather band.

"...These ones certainly are popular lately." Razor remarks with a singular bat of his eyelids ... and proceeds to drop it into his drink, following right up by shoving his index finger down in after it and -- fwoosh! The beverages goes up in an incendiary flash, leaving the inside of the glass bone dry, and the watch a mangled, burnt, and slightly molten mess. Collective gasp. Murmurs. The watch's owner is put in such a state of shock he can't even muster a series of outraged huffs or a "now you see here!"

"I lied about the not damaging it thing, by the way."

-------

Calhoun's jaw stiffened as he contemplated the molten mystical loss of his prize timekeeping possession. The fact that his gaggle of sycophants and homonuclei were now cavorting in raccous guffaws and ribbing him over it was certainly not improving matters. Frankly, Rusalka couldn't remember a time when she'd seen him so at a loss for words. Of all the debauched revelers the awful little bat could have pranked here today, he'd impressively sniffed out the stuffed shirt with the least sense of humor.

It was no small feat to contain her mirth over the matter...so she may or may not have been smiling more broadly than she usually allowed herself when the now-bereft millionnaire heir eyed her from across the room.

She began to applaud.

And others followed suit.

-------

And that was Chassy's cue. 

Tall and spindly though she was, she rolled through the crowd with the determination of a poor-bred bowling ball surrounded by overly rich and pompous pins. Polite by necessity, but unstoppable. She bowled her way to the stage, head ducked in meek effort to maintain anonymity (redheads are common in Beacon, y'know). Her back to the crowd, the smartly-dressed Sentinel stepped up onto the stage and duly twisted the miscreant's arm behind him in a quintessential arrest; brimming with the profesionally rough demeanor of overworked law enforcement.

One hand gripping his wrist, the other gripping his shoulder, she growled a few coarse words and steered him towards the closest car door.

"Sentinel business, make way," she repeated at forced volume, her voice straining to be heard through the congratulatory back-patting showering her charge.

At long last they reached the car door; Chassy couldn't open it fast enough.

-------

"Oh, uh..."

Razor knits his brows at the onset of applause, rubbing the back of his neck with his free hand. He scans the audience, the china shop bull that's barreling toward him not even registering, while repeated glances are darted to the owner of the _lonely heart_ watch he just immolated, making careful note of how the gentleman's ire was growing in proportion to the crowd's mirth.

"That wasn't the whole act, I still have-" he begins to say, cutting himself off with a noise that mixes surprise and alarm into a frankly adorable squeak when his arm is wrenched behind his back and his shoulder seized.

"Hey Spots. I was wondering where you had gotten to." the out of uniform Sentinel remarks without even a brief look towards her - he's been locked up with Chassy enough times to recognize her by the particulars of how she grips - and as she hastens him away he only resists once, for the spectacle of it, twisting to shout back over her shoulder, "_This is censorship_! I'm an _arteest_, I tell you! An _arteest_!"

-------

"Hah! Good show, good **_show_**!"

The voice booms from the back of the car as a man barges his way toward the bat, carefully clapping around what is surely not his first drink of the evening. Amongst those with their finely waxed moustaches, striped suits, and superfluous suspenders, the boisterous man looks downright scruffy. His ashy hair and roughly trimmed beard contrast against the leathery tan of his skin, the sort that brings to mind long hours spent beneath a hot sun. His smile sags on his right side where a thread-thin streak of scar tissue runs straight up from the pit of his cheek to his scalp, skipping across his right eye along the way.

His attire as well sets him apart; dressed not in the evening finery of his fellow guests the man has adorned himself in... well, not the regalia of a man setting out for the wastes, but certainly that of a man intending to give that impression to those fool enough to not know better. Finely polished jackboots shining in the traincar lights giving way to loose trousers with deep pockets, a too-tight button down shirt carefully tucked beneath an obsidian leather belt but nonetheless left closed two buttons too soon, and overtop a jacket seemingly made of rugged fabric and pockets in equal measure. But for the finery of the fabric and adornments and the sharp militant cut of the ensemble one might be allowed to think the man a mere rapscallion, but this man was something altogether more treacherous - a rapscallion of means.

And now a rapscallion of means conquering the standing ovation playing out the seemingly befuddled bat. 

"Bravo, _bra-vo_! A man who knows how to make an entrance and leave his audience clamouring for more! Good show, my fine furred fellow!"

-------

**"BOOOOO!"** yelled the crowd at the buzzkill sentry as she pulled the bat off the stage. Several revellers, acting far below their social station, chucked train cups toward the officials. Those train cups were made of glass! Were they actually throwing glass at representatives of the LAW?! Were they out of their minds?? Luckily, the projectile cutlery had smashed harmlessly (?) against other random objects...so far. These hooligans among the crowd had terrible aim. 

That is until one man, Whimsord Froward, a blue-painted Beacon elixer connoisseur (maybe that was the mistake?) was clipped mid-sip by another glass of fine Felemetian liqueur. The Blue Man pivoted, glowering ineffectually in the direction from whence the goblet had come. He had nothing in his hands. Nothing to throw in retaliation. So he plucked a small white dog out of his neighbor's jewel-encrusted purse, and flung the hapless creature toward his faceless assailant - all within a matter of moments too quick for one's superego to process. The reptile brain, ever quicker than the conscience of the masses, seized the purse's owner suddenly - she sensed the movement behind her, observed dumbly the emptiness of her purse, and - possessed by the growing pulse of violence - smashed the blue connoisseur across his glittering pate with her twinkly stone-heavy bag. Clusters spilled out all over the train floor.

Wyntres leapt to catch the dog as it sailed through the air. Rusalka gathered her many skirts and ducked behind a table.


-------

Chassy, witnessing all of the above culminate with one of Beacon's many redheads fumbling an otherwise admirably gallant rescue attempt of the canid projectile, decided she'd seen enough, if not too much.

With a twinge of guilt for the innocent abandoned (in this case, the dog alone), she pushed Razor into the whirling portal of rushing wind. The day was already won for the hooligan bourgeois; who was she to meddle in their mad affairs.  She released Razor and slammed the door shut behind them. 

The wind that whipped sharply around her ears was a quieter, more welcome sound than the cacophony she'd caged behind them, and she sagged against the bat's supporting weight with a sigh for a breather. Respite for both of them, including the impending lecture due to for the Sentinel's misconduct.

-------

"Well you certainly diffused _that_ situation, Bossman!" the bat proclaims over the rush of the air around them in the exposed walkway between railcars, a lot of the usual playful tone lost in the doing but all there on his face. Surprise flashes across his face for an instant when she slumps into him, in the next moment he has both arms around her and a softer grin. His hands glide up and down over her back and flank in an affectionate caress - while surreptitiously depositing into her pockets the numerous and passingly identical sundial watches he'd collected for his act during his earlier fumble through the crowd of nobles.

"In my defense, it wasn't my idea to get up there!"

-------

And though the woman had pockets aplenty, patience she did not. The moment of opportunity passed, undoubtedly hastened by the bat's preemptive defense and roaming fingers. She straightened and firmly peeled his hand away to hold it- and the stolen item- aloft.

"I should have brought my brother instead," she complained.

Releasing him, she snatched the watch and threw it into the wind. "Destruction of evidence," she griped again, matter-of-fact, "Please stop implicating me in your, ah, pathological crime sprees." A humorous sentiment, given the number of exhibits lining her pocketry.

Arms folding across her narrow torso, she mustered a glare in her inspection of Razor's unauthorized attire. "Where's your uniform."

Meanwhile, back inside the train car, the revelrous man with the facial scar was carrying on, though as the crowd descended into a decidedly undignified state of anarchy that revelry took on a different flavor. At some point in the chaos he had rolled up his sleeves, and busied himself planting his fists roundabout the solar plexi of those unfortunate fops to be rioting within arms reach of him.

Yet unlike the disaffected debutantes and growling gentlemen the leathery man plowed his way through the crowd with a smile on his face and a song in his laughter. Had he thought something like this would unfold? Hoped? Dared to dream deep down in his heart of hearts, perchance? As his knuckles connected with the blue visage of one unfortunate Whimsord Froward it hardly seemed to matter.

"You _could_ have. We both know I'd have crashed the party anyway." Razor said, not the slightest bit sheepish, and certainly not repentant, for being caught red-handed, nor even batting an eye when she cast his ill-gotten gains into the passing wilderness, "I was going to ask you to _return_ those for me, at some point, but now we're _two_ short."

Meanwhile, the gale force flowing over them was making an utter mess of his hair - not just the thick mop atop his head that he called a hairdo but the entirety of his exposed coat. His longer bangs had been rattled apart and were now flapping in the breeze, mostly assaulting her face with their multitudinous scratchy tips, while his face had taken on a resemblance to that of a particularly fluffy breed of canine.

On the inquiry regarding his uniform, he starts his answer with his usual carefree cheeriness and grows progressively more pensive as he dwells on the matter, "Back at the railyard! ...Behind a toolshed, last I saw of it. Prrr_obably_ being used by a bum to wipe his hobo at this point."

He throws up a shrug with a what-can-ya-do grin.

-------

Reflexively, Chassy pushed the few wild strands of red from her own face; the act almost sated the itch in her psyche to try to correct the tangle in front of her. She considered the stream of words that accompanied the mop-in-motion with an unsurprised, flat expression.

 "I am not helping you get a new issue," she said at last, dismissively entering the car leading forward. There was no going backwards - not into that Beacon bourgeois hell- not for anything.

-------

After all, it wasn't like they were here to uphold order or anything like that.

"So what I'm hearing is that I can wear this instead from now on." Razor said as he followed her in, taking over pushing and holding open the door as soon as he could reach past her to do so. Inside out of the wind, he made a small effort to smooth out and straighten his hair back into a semblance of his usual style, and while he was still in the doing added, "Actually I have a hot tip I need to follow up on, want to meet up in the diner in, I don't know, two hours?"

A beat, and then he rolled up his sleeve to reveal still another wrist-mounted solar timepiece, "...I mean, give or take. Can't promise I won't be late, damn watch is broken."

-------

While the casual wit may have coaxed a twitch of a smile from the severe young woman at any other time (as it had done so many other times), Chassy spared the bat nary a glance as she walked through the door and past, stiff and brooding. 

History was being made, and the damned bat still couldn't keep his pants on. Figuratively (she thought of the Luyus heiress that Razor had toasted with a souring look) and literally.

"Do as you like," she said, clipped and cold, "I can't use a Sentinel out of uniform."

-------

Then he was in front of her, hands on her shoulders, squeezing without gripping, his mouth stretched into a grin so large it was forcing his eyes shut.

"That's the spirit!" Razor declared, followed by an exuberant click of tongue on fang, a few over-enthusiastic pats, then leaning in to add in a quieter, but no less chipper voice, "By the way, that lady you wanted me to avoid at all costs? I'm trying to get everyone to start calling her _The Bee Lady_, so if you could use _every_ excuse you can think of to work her into conversation calling her _The Bee Lady_ I would owe you at _least_ five favours."

And so, without waiting for her to respond, he spun on his heels and began to strut towards the door on the far end of the car, a hand high over his head waving to her without looking back, "See ya soon, Bossman!"

-------

"I-" 

When met with the wind outside, the woman's voice stood no chance. She closed her mouth and frowned at the door as he hauled it shut.

"...was there, Razor." She completed the sentence seconds later, lamely late and unheard in the sealed car. Her cheeks belatedly tried their hand at Beacon-red, and they succeeded brilliantly.

It hadn't been the man's self-motivated nearness, his touch, or even the heat of his breath on wind-chill as he needlessly explained (in close proximity) the Luyus woman's weird nickname. 

It had been the other Sentinel's bouyantly gleeful expression for the duration that triggered her delayed self-consciousness-- now full force and burning.

"Damnit, Razor."

But _she_ was still in uniform, and therefore _she_ still had a job to do. The Bee Lady's party car excluded. _...ah, damn._

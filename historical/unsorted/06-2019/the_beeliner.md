``` ♫ City of beacons, beacon of the land n' sea,```

```Land of unsurpassed tech-no-lo-gee, ```

```Sea of pleasures, fortress of vita-li-ty,```

```Now we have trains! Trains to carry you-u-u-ooh ooh ooh```

```n' me! ♫ ```

Ten harpists on dollies, three violinists on roller skates gyrate in circles around a grand piano on the great rotating mirror dias in the center of the Beacon Station crowd. In the outer ring of this spectacle, a troup of butterfly mimes act out each line of the song as the literal peacock chanteur warbles the 'modern' cover of this passe Beaconite diddy. This is what happens when you let your intern plan a celebration.

Cross-armed and surly against a wall with oversized crownmolding and a shell-pink chair rail, a careless vision-obscuring forelock is the only thing protecting this crowd from half of two evil eyes.

"First time in Beacon?"

She casts a sidelong glance. A tall, narrow man in blue pinstripes has sidled up next to her, sporting a pencil thin mustache and greased-down dirty blonde curls. He is smiling ingratiatingly.
"If only it were so."

Not seeming to take her meaning, the man (he was drunk on the fruits of her libations table, she now realized, as he reeked of false cherries and seltzer belch) instead took comfort in newfound rapport with this beautiful young lady. "Ah, quite right, I daresay." He drew in a long heady breath of perfumed city summer air. "One never gets to relive those first moments twice, mm? That's the bittersweet nature of finally arriving home..." He lit himself the spliff he'd recently procured from a crystal bowl under the live-awning. Inhaling deeply, he closed his eyes to fully savor the ecstasy of this delicious moment in time, allowing the smoke and fleeting sensations of the day to suffuse his consciousness without visual disturbance. 

Exhaling, he concluded, "In that sense - you really can never go home again..."

When he opened his eyes, she was gone.

"Ha ha ha ha if they play that song one more time I'm going to **bite** somebody." remarked a slightly-less-unremarkable-than-usual Sentinel standing cornered between a waste bin and a lamp post, taking full advantage of the din to keep his words from all but the most attentive of ears, and masking them further with a gaping, saccharine smile.

One would be forgiven for mistaking this particular officer of the city for part of the performing troupe with his large and pointed ears, fur-covered face, and the telltale pale blue glow in his eyes that marked him as one of the crystal-blessed beastfolk of the eastern woodlands. Several already had, despite him being in full uniform and stood aside from the thick throng along the immaculate new platform.

"If you good people could start getting rowdy and give me an excuse to begin bashing your heads together that would be fan**tastic**." he went on to say as he treated the doe-eyed child of a pointing parent to a flawlessly regal wave and clicked his tongue against one of his sizable fangs in relief when the youngster's short-spanned attention sent them both scurrying elsewhere.

"...How long until next rotation."
